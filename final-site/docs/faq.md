Great for development servers and monitoring. [Background commands guide](/faqs/what-are-background-commands.html)

**Q: What is Slash Commands in Claude Code?** A: Slash commands are built-in Claude Code commands starting with "/" for session management. Key commands include `/add-dir` for workspace expansion, `/mcp` for server management, and `/project` for repository operations. [Slash commands guide](/faqs/what-is-slash-commands-in-claude-code.html)

**Q: What are the most important Claude Code commands?** A: Essential commands include `/compact` for context management, `/model` for switching models, `/clear` for fresh conversations, and natural language requests like "read this file" or "create a component".

**Q: How do I see all Claude Code commands?** A: Type `/help` in Claude Code to see available slash commands, or simply ask "what commands are available?" for a natural language explanation of capabilities.

**Q: What is the Task tool in Claude Code and when should you use it?** A: The Task tool launches parallel sub-agents for complex operations. Each Task creates an independent agent for file operations, research, or analysis. Use for multi-step tasks requiring parallel processing. [Task tool guide](/faqs/what-is-task-tool-in-claude-code.html)

**Q: What are sub-agents in Claude Code?** A: Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific tasks in parallel while the main agent coordinates workflow. Two approaches: manual sub-agents for explicit control and custom agents for automatic delegation with isolated contexts and custom configurations. [Sub-agents guide](/faqs/what-are-sub-agents-in-claude-code.html)

**Q: What does "Auto-Compact" mean in Claude Code?** A: When context window approaches limit, Claude Code automatically summarizes the conversation to free up space and continue working. You can also manually compact using `/compact` command. [How it works](/faqs/what-is-claude-code-auto-compact.html)

**Q: What is Micro-Compact in Claude Code?** A: Micro-compact automatically clears old tool calls to extend your session length, triggering automatically when context grows long. This helps you work longer without needing to run a full `/compact` command and losing important project context. [Learn more](/faqs/what-is-micro-compact.html)

**Q: What does "context window full" mean in Claude Code?** A: The context window is Claude's memory limit for your conversation. When full, Claude can't process more information. Use `/compact` to summarize and free space, or `/clear` for a fresh start. [Manage context](/mechanics-context-window-depletion.html)

**Q: How do I manage Claude Code context window efficiently?** A: Use smaller files, strategic `/compact` commands, organize projects into focused sessions, and leverage sub-agents for parallel tasks. Avoid loading massive files unnecessarily. [Optimization tips](/mechanics-context-window-depletion.html)

**Q: Should I restart Claude Code or use the /clear command?** A: Use `/clear` first - it clears the context window while preserving your session and `CLAUDE.md` instructions. Only restart when switching projects, updating `CLAUDE.md`, or experiencing session issues. Restarting destroys accumulated knowledge that helps with future tasks. [Clear vs restart](/faqs/restarting-claude-code.html)

**Q: Can Claude Code analyze images and screenshots from my computer?** A: Yes, Claude Code can analyze images from your computer. Reference image file paths in your conversation or paste images directly into the terminal. Useful for debugging UI issues, analyzing screenshots, and visual documentation.

**Q: What is the Task tool in Claude Code and when should you use it?** A: The Task tool launches parallel sub-agents. Each "Task" creates a sub-agent, indicated within the Claude Code UI by a flashing bubble that turns green when complete. [Task agents guide](/mechanics-task-agent-tools.html)

**Q: How do I configure terminal setup for Claude Code?** A: Run `/terminal-setup` within Claude Code to automatically configure Shift+Enter for linebreaks in VS Code and iTerm2. Use `\` + Enter as a quick escape for linebreaks when keyboard shortcuts aren't configured. [Terminal setup guide](/faqs/claude-code-terminal-setup.html)

**Q: How do I customize the status line in Claude Code?** A: Use the `/statusline` command or ask Claude directly to configure your status line. Claude Code's specialized statusline-setup agent automatically handles all configuration, reading your shell's PS1 settings and enabling advanced customizations like current time, session duration, git information, and custom scripts. [Status line guide](/faqs/status-line-claude-code.html)

**Q: What is the Status Line in Claude Code?** A: The status line is a customizable area at the bottom of the Claude Code interface that displays contextual information about your session, such as the current model, directory, and Git branch. [Learn more](/faqs/what-is-statusline.html)

**Q: How do I set up terminal bell notifications on Windows WSL?** A: For Windows WSL users, standard terminal bell often doesn't work. Use PowerShell commands for audio notifications instead. [Setup notifications](/faqs/claude-code-terminal-bell-notifications.html)

**Q: What is Sub-Agent Delegation in Claude Code?** A: Sub-agent delegation uses the Task tool to spawn parallel agents for asynchronous processing. Multiple sub-agents work simultaneously on different aspects of complex tasks, avoiding sequential waiting and improving efficiency. [Sub-agent guide](/faqs/what-is-sub-agent-delegation-in-claude-code.html)

**Q: How do sub-agents work in Claude Code and when should I use them?** A: Sub-agents are parallel task executors that run independently with their own context window. They're useful for tasks requiring multiple file operations or research phases. For example, if Claude needs to write several different files on different topics, each sub-agent can research and write independently. Sub-agents perform tasks significantly faster than the interactive Claude instance.

**Q: Do sub-agents consume the main agent's context window?** A: Sub-agents have their own separate context windows and are provided with the task and light context. Only the results they return consume space in the main agent's context window, not their internal processing. This makes them efficient for complex multi-step tasks.

**Q: How do I control how many sub-agents Claude Code uses?** A: You can explicitly request the number of sub-agents: "Use 3 sub-agents to handle this task" or "Create a sub-agent for each file that needs updating." Claude also automatically uses sub-agents for non-Write/Edit tasks when appropriate.

**Q: Can you use Claude Code with multiple codebases simultaneously?** A: Yes, open a separate terminal window for each codebase. Each Claude Code instance runs independently with its own context and session.

**Q: How should I optimize my Claude Code usage strategy?** A: Pro users: Focus on Sonnet for all development work. Max users: Use Opus for planning and complex problems, Sonnet for implementation. Monitor reset timing and use Plan Mode for strategic workflows. [Strategic usage](/faqs/claude-code-usage.html)

## AI & Human-Computer Interface (HCI)[​](#ai--human-computer-interface-hci "Direct link to AI & Human-Computer Interface (HCI)")

This section explores the fascinating intersection of advanced AI tools and the physical interfaces we use to control them. Drawing from insights on my [WearOS blog](https://wearoscentral.com/), these FAQs use modern smartwatches as a practical case study to discuss how we access and interact with AI beyond a keyboard and terminal.

**Q: How does AI integrate with physical user interfaces like smartwatches?** A: AI integrates into wearables primarily through advanced voice assistants, like [Gemini](https://wearoscentral.com/mechanics-gemini-integration/) on Wear OS, which act as a natural language interface for the device's functions. Instead of navigating menus, you can speak commands to manage tasks, get information, or interact with apps. This turns the watch into a more hands-free, conversational tool, where the AI orchestrates actions across different services like your calendar and messages based on your voice requests. Currently Anthropic's Claude does not have a presence on WearOS, however I will be experimenting with different methods of interfacing with Claude on [WearOS](https://wearoscentral.com).

**Q: What are the current challenges in accessing AI on wearable devices?** A: A primary challenge is that hardware design often lags behind AI's growing importance. On many smartwatches, including the [Galaxy Watch](https://wearoscentral.com/watches/samsung-galaxy-watch-8/) series, the most accessible physical buttons are restricted to core, non-AI functions, while AI assistants are assigned to less intuitive actions like a long press. This creates a disconnect where the most powerful tool on the device isn't the easiest to access, highlighting a need for hardware and HCI philosophies to evolve with AI capabilities. Unfortunately Google's `Circle to Search` like HCI is also not available so there is no context-aware AI experience. Understandably the screen space is limited so a lot of innovation is necessary to make AI experiences work within the constraints of a smartwatch environment.

**Q: How do different HCI methods (e.g., Touch Bezel, buttons) affect AI interaction?** A: Each HCI method serves a different purpose that can either complement or conflict with AI. Touch/Rotating Bezels: These are excellent for direct, tactile manipulation, like scrolling through a list that an AI has generated. The haptic feedback can make digital navigation feel more precise and physical. It is uncommon to use [touch/rotating](https://wearoscentral.com/mechanics-bezel-navigation-patterns/) bezel to activate AI, however it can be worth exploring generated lists of options which are automatically displayed on interaction. If activation and navigation are done in a single motion the HCI can provide a seamless AI experience. The alternative requires a user to navigate between two different HCIs to achieve a task (touch screen, touch/rotating bezel). Touch Screens: Best for direct visual interaction with app interfaces, however due to the small screen it requires a user to either perform multiple actions to scroll through the options generated the AI or for the AI to provide concise answers which deliver finite value. There is also the alternative of using audio but this is not necessarily the ideal modality for when a user is in a publicssetting. Buttons: Ideal for instant, `muscle memory` access to critical functions. The friction occurs when these systems don't work in harmony. For instance, having a highly responsive AI assistant is less effective if its activation is buried in a [secondary button function](https://wearoscentral.com/mechanics-button-customization/) , forcing a less efficient interaction pattern.

**Q: How could we monitor complex AI tasks, like those using sub-agents, from a watch?** A: Monitoring advanced AI on a small screen requires a shift from detailed logs to intuitive visual indicators. Drawing inspiration from how Claude Code shows a flashing bubble for its [Task tool](https://claudelog.com/mechanics-task-agent-tools) a watch could use a dynamic complication on the watch face. For example, if you ask the AI to `plan a weekend trip`, a complication could appear showing an icon with `3 agents active`. Tapping it could reveal that the `Flights`, `Hotels`, and `Activities` sub-agents are working in parallel, with simple progress bars for each. This provides at-a-glance status without overwhelming the user. Alternatively the subagent processes could have dedicated [WearOS tiles](https://wearoscentral.com/mechanics-tile-composition/) which displays the on-going status of agents.

**Q: What is the role of haptic feedback in AI-powered interfaces?** A: Haptic feedback is crucial for making digital interactions feel tangible. On my [Galaxy Watch Ultra](https://wearoscentral.com/watches/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra/), the [Touch Bezel](https://wearoscentral.com/mechanics-touch-bezel-experience/) uses haptics to simulate the `click` of a physical bezel, providing confident, precise control. In an AI context, haptics can confirm that a sub-agent task is being completed, it could be used for indicating the kind of issue an agent is experiencing or it could be used to indicate the progress within an on-going task. The additional sensory experience compliments the existing audio feedback which is provided via the terminal when interfacing with Claude Code subagents. In the future, distinct haptic patterns could even signify the status of background AI tasks (e.g., one buzz for success, two for an error).

**Q: How does the concept of "context awareness" in AI apply to wearables?** A: Context awareness is the ability of a system to understand your situation and act accordingly. I've seen a simple version of this in the Touch Bezel on my [WearOS](https://wearoscentral.com) watch, which automatically knows to control volume during a call or [scroll](https://wearoscentral.com/mechanics-fluid-scrolling/) through tiles from the watch face. A truly context-aware AI on a wearable would take this much further, using sensor data (location, heart rate, calendar) to anticipate needs. For example, it might proactively suggest a less stressful route to your next meeting if it detects an elevated heart rate and sees traffic delays. This is similar to how Claude Code uses the context of an entire codebase to inform its actions. Other sensory data could also be interpreted by AI to determine what kind of functionality or suggestions to provide a user when interfacing with an aspect of a watch e.g., buttons or the physical bezel.

**Q: How will wearable interfaces need to evolve for an AI-first future?** A: The current app-centric and tile-based model will likely become secondary. The future interface will be a dynamic, goal-oriented canvas `orchestrated by an AI agent`. Instead of you opening four different apps, you'll state a goal like, `Help me prepare for my presentation`, and the AI will assemble a temporary UI with your notes, calendar event, teleprompter controls, and stress-monitoring from the heart rate sensor. The interface will fluidly adapt to your task, moving beyond rigid grids of icons to a truly intelligent and responsive user experience. The generated interface would be navigable via standard methods e.g., touch scrolling or touch/physical bezel. I believe the future of [WearOS](https://wearoscentral.com/mechanics-touch-bezel-experience/) is to build lightweight dynamic experiences which adapt based on the contextual and sensory data provided by the user.

**Q: How could an AI like Claude influence future wearable interfaces?** A: While current assistants like Gemini are great for executing commands, a more advanced AI could bring deeper reasoning and workflow automation to wearables. Imagine a `Claude` for [WearOS](https://wearoscentral.com/mechanics-touch-bezel-experience/) that doesn't just respond to requests but helps you plan and execute multi-step tasks. You could ask it to `review my last workout, compare my heart rate zones to previous runs, and suggest an interval plan for tomorrow`, and it would analyze the data, generate a plan, and schedule it in your calendar—a level of complex reasoning that goes beyond simple task execution.

**Q: How could AI make battery warnings smarter and more useful?** A: Traditional battery warnings are reactive; they tell you when power is low but lack the context of what you need to accomplish. An AI could transform this by acting as an intelligent advisor. By understanding your calendar, location, and usage patterns, it could provide proactive, actionable advice. For example, instead of a simple `15% battery remaining` alert, it might say: `You have 15% battery left. This is enough to get you home via your normal transport routes` or `You have 15% battery left and are on route to arrive at your destination with 5% battery remaining`. WearOS's [Gemini integration](https://wearoscentral.com/mechanics-gemini-integration/) AI integration is rudimentary and I am personally exploring what kinds of HCI experiences can be created with Claude on [WearOS](https://wearoscentral.com/mechanics-touch-bezel-experience/).

**Q: What are the most powerful devices that can handle AI on WearOS?** A: Any of Samsung's modern [Galaxy Watch 7 series](https://wearoscentral.com/watches/samsung-galaxy-watch-7/) watches or newer have the Exynos W1000 chip, which is powerful enough to enable us to build complex fluid experiences. I personally have the `Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra` and `Galaxy Watch 8 Classic` and am exploring what the SOTA AI X HCI experience could be like on a wrist.
