### Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

**Prerequisites**

-   Python 3.11+ (specifically, not 3.12+) with uv package manager
-   Git for repository cloning
-   Language servers for target programming languages (auto-installed)
-   Claude Code or compatible MCP client

**Recommended Installation (UVX)**

```bash
# Direct execution from GitHub (recommended for MCP)

# Windows:

uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena-mcp-server.exe

# Linux/macOS:

uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena-mcp-server

```

**MCP Configuration**

```bash
{

  "mcpServers": {

    "serena": {

      "command": "uvx",

      "args": [

        "--from",

        "git+https://github.com/oraios/serena",

        "serena-mcp-server"

      ]

    }

  }

}

```

**Alternative: Local Development Setup**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (REQUIRED)

git clone https://github.com/oraios/serena

cd serena

# 2. Optional: Copy configuration template

cp src/serena/resources/serena_config.template.yml serena_config.yml

# 3. Run the MCP server

uv run serena-mcp-server

```

**For Local Installation MCP Configuration**

```bash
{

  "mcpServers": {

    "serena": {

      "command": "/absolute/path/to/uv",

      "args": [

        "run",

        "--directory",

        "/absolute/path/to/serena",

        "serena-mcp-server"

      ]

    }

  }

}

```

**Language Server Setup**

```bash
# Serena automatically installs language servers for:

# Python (pylsp), JavaScript/TypeScript (typescript-language-server)

# Rust (rust-analyzer), Go (gopls), and 8+ other languages

# No manual configuration required

```

* * *

* * *

### Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

**Semantic Code Analysis**

```bash
# Example AI interactions through Claude Code:

# "Analyze the authentication flow in this project"

# "Find all functions that handle user data validation"

# "Explain the relationship between these classes"

# "Refactor this module to improve separation of concerns"

```

Serena provides deep code understanding that goes beyond simple text analysis. It comprehends code structure, relationships, and semantics through language server integration, enabling sophisticated code analysis and intelligent editing suggestions through natural language interaction.

**Advanced Capabilities**

-   **Project Understanding**: Analyze entire codebases and understand architectural patterns
-   **Intelligent Editing**: Make precise code changes based on semantic understanding
-   **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Track function calls, imports, and dependencies
-   **Code Quality Assessment**: Identify potential issues and improvement opportunities
