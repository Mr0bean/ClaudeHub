### Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

TDD Guard is a utility that enforces Test-Driven Development principles for Claude Code by intercepting file modification operations and validating TDD adherence. It blocks actions that violate TDD rules, specifically preventing implementation without failing tests, over-implementation beyond test requirements, and adding multiple tests simultaneously.

### Features[​](#features "Direct link to Features")

-   **Test-First Enforcement** - Blocks implementation without failing tests
-   **Over-Implementation Prevention** - Prevents code beyond current test requirements
-   **Multiple Test Detection** - Blocks adding multiple tests simultaneously
-   **Customizable Rules** - Adjust validation rules to match your TDD style
-   **Multi-Language Support** - Works with JavaScript, Python, PHP, Go, and Rust
-   **Automated Process Enforcement** - Let TDD Guard handle discipline so you focus on design

### Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

**Requirements**

-   Node.js 18+
-   Claude Code
-   Test framework for your language

**Quick Start**

**1\. Install TDD Guard**

```bash
npm install -g tdd-guard

```

**2\. Add Test Reporter** TDD Guard needs to capture test results from your test runner. Choose your language:

-   **JavaScript/TypeScript**
-   **Python (pytest)**
-   **PHP (PHPUnit)**
-   **Go**
-   **Rust**

See the [official repository](https://github.com/nizos/tdd-guard) for language-specific test reporter setup.

**3\. Configure Claude Code Hook** Use the `/hooks` command in Claude Code:

1.  Type `/hooks` in Claude Code
2.  Select **PreToolUse - Before tool execution**
3.  Choose **\+ Add new matcher...** and enter: `Write|Edit|MultiEdit|TodoWrite`
4.  Select **\+ Add new hook...** and enter: `tdd-guard`
5.  Choose where to save (Project settings recommended)

See [Strengthening TDD Enforcement](https://github.com/nizos/tdd-guard) to prevent agents from bypassing validation.

### Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

TDD Guard runs as a separate process and validates file modifications against TDD principles. It intercepts `Write`, `Edit`, and `MultiEdit` operations, checking for three primary TDD violations:

1.  Implementing functionality without a failing test
2.  Over-implementing beyond test requirements
3.  Adding multiple tests simultaneously

This automation lets you focus on problem-solving and design instead of manually policing TDD process adherence.

**Security Notice** TDD Guard hooks execute with your full user permissions. Review hook configurations carefully and ensure your development environment is properly secured.

For detailed configuration options and advanced usage patterns, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/nizos/tdd-guard).

### Benefits[​](#benefits "Direct link to Benefits")

TDD Guard automates TDD discipline enforcement, providing several key advantages:

-   **Consistent Code Quality** - Prevents common AI coding mistakes like jumping straight to implementation
-   **Thorough Test Coverage** - Ensures tests are written first and cover all functionality
-   **Living Documentation** - Your test suite becomes comprehensive documentation of your codebase
-   **Focus on Design** - Automated process enforcement lets you concentrate on problem-solving
-   **Extended Enforcement** - Can be configured to enforce additional coding standards beyond TDD

Performance Note

Be aware that TDD Guard can introduce lag to your `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, and `TodoWrite` operations as it validates each action against TDD principles.

##### TDD Automation

TDD Guard automates the discipline of Test-Driven Development, letting you focus on problem-solving and design while ensuring consistent adherence to TDD principles.
