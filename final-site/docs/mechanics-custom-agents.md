# Custom Agents | ClaudeLog

`Sub-agents` were always one of Claude Code's greatest strengths. However, the expectation for users to know when to invoke them manually and remember what expertise to give them always held back the functionality for normal users. No longer...

`Custom agents` are specialized agents that can be utilized to solve specific tasks. They are **automatically invoked by Claude** in a similar manner to how `Tools` are invoked automatically!

This approach brings incredible potential! Given how reliable and well-developed the MCP tools ecosystem has become, I envision a thriving future where we collaboratively build, share, and exchange agents. If you have cool agents or want to iterate on existing ones, be sure to head over to [r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/).

Unlike traditional `sub-agents`, they have their own `custom system prompt`, tools, and context window separate from their `delegating agent`. `Custom agents` are engineered to be specialized, isolated and efficient. Their configuration is integrated natively within Claude Code, effectively removing the need for third-party persona orchestration tools.

### The Game Will Never Be The Same[​](#the-game-will-never-be-the-same "Direct link to The Game Will Never Be The Same")

**Automatic Delegation** - This mechanic is powerful and scalable because of the automatic delegation of tasks to specialized isolated agents. The integration process is seamless and builds on Claude's reliability when using tools. Claude delegates tasks based on the task description in your request, the description field in agent configurations, the current context, and available tools.

**No Manual Invocation Required** - You no longer need to remember which role `sub-agent` to use or when. Claude intelligently routes tasks to the appropriate specialist, just like how it automatically selects the right tools. However, you will need to benchmark how reliable the task routing is within your setup, especially if you flood Claude with too many `custom agent` options.

### Core Benefits[​](#core-benefits "Direct link to Core Benefits")

-   **Separate Context Windows** - Each `custom agent` operates with its own context window, separate from the `delegating agent`. This allows larger tasks to be completed without concerning the `delegating agent` with every detail, preventing different tasks from [poisoning the context](/mechanics/poison-context-awareness/) while maintaining peak performance.
    
-   **Specialized System Prompts** - Individual `custom agent` system prompts can be scoped precisely, avoiding the inheritance of redundant context, thus preserving the limited context window.
    
-   **Role-Specific Tools** - Agents can be configured with specific tools, helping prevent security issues by only allowing trusted agents to perform certain tasks. Specific agents can be tested and evaluated for reliability at their role. This first-party level of integration takes the concept of [Split role sub-agents](/mechanics/split-role-sub-agents/) to the next level!
    
-   **Community Sharing** - Once refined, `custom agents` can be shared across projects, among teams, or even in [r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/), creating a collaborative ecosystem of ever-evolving specialized agents.

### Quick Start Guide[​](#quick-start-guide "Direct link to Quick Start Guide")

`Custom agents` were introduced in Claude Code [v1.0.60](/claude-code-changelog/#v1060)

**1\. Open the Custom Agents Interface**

```bash
/agents

```

**2\. Select 'Create New Agent'** Choose whether to create a project-level or user-level `custom agent`.

**3\. Define Your Agent**

-   **Recommended**: Generate with Claude first, then customize to make it yours
-   Describe your agent in detail and when it should be used
-   Select specific tools or leave blank to inherit all tools
-   Edit the system prompt to define role, capabilities, and approach
-   Pick the color of your agent
-   Review the configuration of your `custom agent`

**4\. Save and Use** Your `custom agent` is now available! Claude will use it automatically when appropriate, or you can invoke it explicitly: `Use the algorithmic complexity specialist agent to analyze this function.`

**File Format**:

```bash
---

name: your-agent-name

description: Description of when this agent should be invoked

tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted

model: sonnet  # Optional - sonnet, opus, or haiku. Inherits if omitted

---

Your agent's system prompt goes here. Define the role, capabilities,

and approach to solving problems. Include specific instructions,

best practices, and any constraints the agent should follow.

```

* * *

### Basic Usage[​](#basic-usage "Direct link to Basic Usage")

**Automatic Invocation** - Once created, your `custom agents` work automatically. Claude will select and use the appropriate agent based on your request and the agent's description.

**Manual Invocation** - You can also explicitly request a specific agent:

```bash
Use the algorithmic complexity specialist agent to analyze this function.

```

**Task Delegation** - Claude intelligently routes tasks to specialized isolated agents, similar to how it automatically selects tools for different operations.

### Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

`Custom agents` are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in two possible locations:

Type

Location

Scope

Priority

Project agents

`.claude/agents/`

Available in current project

Highest

User agents

`~/.claude/agents/`

Available across all projects

Lower

When agent names conflict, project-level agents take precedence over user-level agents.

**Configuration Fields**

Field

Required

Description

name

Yes

Unique identifier using lowercase letters and hyphens

description

Yes

Natural language description of the agent's purpose

tools

No

Comma-separated list of specific tools. If omitted, inherits all tools from the main thread

model

No

Model to use for this agent: sonnet, opus, or haiku. If omitted, inherits model

### Best Practices[​](#best-practices "Direct link to Best Practices")

-   **Start with Claude Generation** - Generate your initial agent with Claude, then customize it to make it your own.
    
-   **Separation of Concerns** - Like with programming, better separation of concerns in your `custom agents` leads to better performance, maintainability, inspectability, and shareability.
    
-   **Provide Examples** - Include positive/negative examples in your system prompts. LLMs excel at pattern recognition and repetition, so be sure to provide a sufficient amount of distinct instances.
    
-   **Progressive Tool Expansion** - Begin with a carefully scoped set of tools for your `custom agent` and progressively expand the tool scope as you validate its behavior and identify additional capabilities needed for optimal performance.

### Community Vision[​](#community-vision "Direct link to Community Vision")

I'm beyond excited for the future of agentic workflows! We should all work together to refine optimal instances of various agents and share them among each other. This kind of initiative is much more viable with automatic delegation since users don't need to understand when to activate agents.

Sharing custom agents is as simple as copying a single Markdown file. For example, a `code-reviewer.md` agent created for one project can be instantly shared with teammates or the community:

```bash
---

name: code-reviewer

description: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.

tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash

model: opus

---

You are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards of code quality and security.

When invoked:

1. Run git diff to see recent changes

2. Focus on modified files

3. Begin review immediately

Review checklist:

- Code is simple and readable

- Functions and variables are well-named

- No duplicated code

- Proper error handling

- No exposed secrets or API keys

- Input validation implemented

- Good test coverage

- Performance considerations addressed

- Time complexity of algorithms analyzed

- Licenses of integrated libraries checked

Provide feedback organized by priority:

- Critical issues (must fix)

- Warnings (should fix)

- Suggestions (consider improving)

Include specific examples of how to fix issues.

```

Your goal should be to build a comprehensive collection of battle-tested `custom agents` from different domains, allowing you to effectively tackle any task.

Community Collaboration

The true power of custom agents emerges through community sharing and iteration. Build upon others' agents, share your specialized creations, and contribute to a growing ecosystem of battle-tested specialists. Visit [r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/) to discover, share, and refine agents collaboratively.

Token Cost Awareness

Each custom agent invocation carries a variable initialization cost based on tool count and configuration complexity. Design your [agents](/mechanics/agent-engineering/) thoughtfully to ensure they provide sufficient value to justify this overhead, focusing on specialized tasks that benefit from dedicated context and expertise.

Model Selection Strategy

This new capability opens unexplored territory! While logical pairings make sense (Haiku for simple tasks, opus for complex analysis), cross-experiment to discover surprising synergies.

##### Specialized Intelligence

Custom agents act like specialized team members - each with domain expertise, specific tools, and focused responsibilities. This creates a collaborative AI environment where the right specialist handles each task.
