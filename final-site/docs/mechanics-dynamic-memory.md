# Dynamic Memory | ClaudeLog

When Claude Code is in interactive mode you can have Claude modify its own `CLAUDE.md` temporarily to run tasks with a specific context. After the task is completed you can ask Claude to revert the `CLAUDE.md` back to its previous state. There are several ways of backing up the `CLAUDE.md`:

-   **Git versioning**: Use git stash or commit before changes for easy rollback
-   **File duplication**: Have Claude copy to a backup filename like `CLAUDE.md.backup`

To change the information persisted through the `CLAUDE.md` interface you can use 'quick Memory' with #.

This mechanic is useful if you have a `CLAUDE.md` library which specifies the processes for performing different tasks. Unfortunately, Claude is currently unable to read changes to his `CLAUDE.md` into 'memory' unless it utilises explicit commands such as:

-   **Quick Memory**: Using # commands to temporarily change persisted information
-   **Memory refresh commands**: Explicitly asking Claude to re-read the modified `CLAUDE.md`
-   **Session restart**: Starting a new Claude Code session to pick up changes
-   **Explicit file reads**: Using read commands to load the updated content

This led to me exploring getting Claude to spawn another instance of itself in a directory which has a different `CLAUDE.md`. The benefits being:

-   **Cleaner context separation**: Each spawned instance operates with its own specific `CLAUDE.md` context
-   **No memory reload issues**: New instances automatically load their directory's `CLAUDE.md`
-   **Parallel processing**: Multiple contexts can run simultaneously without interference
-   **Reduced context pollution**: Previous session context doesn't bleed into the new specialized task

**Note:** Claude instances will automatically crawl up the directory structure and read any `CLAUDE.md` files they encounter. So to have a strict separation of context ensure the project directory `CLAUDE.md` is lightweight and non-specific.
